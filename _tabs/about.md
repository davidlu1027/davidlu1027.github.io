# About Me

I am currently a graduate student at the <font color="yellow">National Taiwan University Department of Electrical Engineering</font>. In university, I joined the <font color="yellow">Energy-Efficient Circuits and Systems Lab (EECS Lab)</font> to develop energy-efficient machine learning accelerators that can reduce the power consumption of IoT devices. Later, I did an internship at <font color="yellow">Academia Sinica</font> (an eminent research institute in Taiwan) where I researched compute-in-memory architecture. I became familiar with low-power circuit design. I plan to continue exploring <font color="yellow">machine learning accelerators in IoT devices</font> in my master’s studies.
