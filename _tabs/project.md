# [Energy-efficient keyword spotting accelerator](https://davidlu1027.github.io/posts/accelerator/) :
- Designed a low-power circuit that can identify ten keywords from one-second long utterances.

- Sent our design to Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute and taped out a depthwise separable convolution neural network (DSCNN) keyword spotting accelerator.

# [MFCC feature extraction circuit](https://davidlu1027.github.io/posts/mfcc/):

- Designed a low-power circuit that can extract MFCC features from one-second long utterances.

- The extracted MFCC features can be utilized to recognize keywords.

# [Investigating Ferroelectric Minor Loop Dynamics and History Effect](https://davidlu1027.github.io/posts/ferro/) :

- Constructed multiple phase-fi eld models based on the time-dependent Landauâ€“Ginzburg framework to simulate phase-fi eld multidomain switching model.

- Researched the correlation between ferroelectric material domain size and the coercive field.
