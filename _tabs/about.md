# About Me

I am currently a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Physics and Astronomy working on my Ph.D in Physics. I earned my M.S. in physics at BGSU studying symbiotic stars and variable stars in general using time series photometry. Before graduate school I spent four years at Purdue University earning my B.S. in Honors Physics with a minor in astronomy.

While at Pittsburgh and Purdue, I've participated in Women in Physics groups. Combating patriarchal mindsets about who is welcome in STEM fields is so important: I've seen several promising physicists driven away by blatant sexism. The scientific community is poorer for their loss. Supporting diversity leads to a thriving diversity of thoughts, which leads to breakthrough discoveries.

When I'm not coding or puzzling over research papers, you can find me reading sci-fi and fantasy books on my Kindle, going on adventures with my friends, or cooking with my wife. I'm an avid cyclist who's ridden more than 12,000 miles to date, including a trans-continental trip with [Bike & Build](https://bikeandbuild.org). My interests also include sound design, woodworking, and electronics.
